                Born and raised in China, I moved to the U.S. at 18 to pursue my
                undergraduate studies at the University of Southern California,
                where I majored in Accounting and minored in Dance. Afterward, I
                relocated to the Bay Area to earn a Master's degree in Computer
                Science from Northeastern University.

                My home is filled with the playful antics and affectionate purrs
                of my two beloved cats, YY and Chloe. YY is a short-hair boy
                with energetic and inquisitive nature, while Chloe is a
                long-hair girl with grace and elegance. Together, they bring
                immeasurable joy and comfort into my life. More than just pets,
                they have become my confidants and loyal companions, and their
                unconditional love and playful personalities make them truly my
                best friends in the world!
